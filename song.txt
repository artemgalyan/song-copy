They say women cry when walls retire
They say that men die when walls retire
When walls retire

Unconventional
Deconstructive conversations
(Teach us how to eat)
I will never let you go
Conversational
Reconstructive demonstrations
(Teach us how to speak)
Why, confess the final blow
Teach us how to eat
From your broken hands
'Cause nothing seems to grow
Teach us how to speak
The language of your only dreams
No one seems to understand that
We are falling to our knees

I forgot to pray
You forgot to say please
(Kill me)
I never let you go
I forgot to go
You forgot to know me
(Teach us how to speak)
Why confess the final blow
Teach us how to eat
From your broken hands
'Cause nothing seems to grow
Teach us how to speak
The language of your only dreams

No one seems to understand that
We are falling to our knees
Blindness serves not god nor man
So we are falling into disease
We're falling into disease

I'm crawling, I'm crawling
I'm crawling, I'm crawling
I'm crawling, I'm crawling
I'm crawling, I'm crawling

We're falling, we're falling
We're falling, we're falling
We're falling into, into disease

Disease, disease, disease
Disease, disease, disease
Disease, disease, disease
Disease, disease

We've fallen, we've fallen
We've fallen, we've fallen
We've fallen, we've fallen
We've fallen, we've fallen

No one seems to understand that
We are falling to our knees
Blindness serves not god nor man
So we are falling into disease
Disease...
